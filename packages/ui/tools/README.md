# `tools/` -- package tooling

Node-side measurement, vendoring, smoke, report and HMR tooling for `@spell/ui`, plus the pages it drives.  Run
from the repo root through the root scripts;  results land in `tools/results/` (git-ignored), and `yarn report`
turns them into the tables of `docs/report.md`.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `cli.ts` | the command line behind `yarn vendor`, `measure`, `smoke`, `serve`, `report` |
| `package.config.ts` | `PACKAGE` (`PackageConfig`):  entries, shared entries (`core`, `forms`), externals, peer list, module => bucket;  `DIST_IMPORTS` for import maps |
| `tools.types.ts` | `PackageConfig`, result shapes (`MeasureResults`, `SmokeResults`, `LocResults`), `SolidIdentityHook` |
| `BundleMeasure.ts` | in-memory `vite build` with the repo's config, modules bucketed into library / shared entries / own per family / lazy;  the library AS USED (bindings `dist/` imports) and in full;  standalone per-family builds;  structural checks |
| `PeerVendor.ts` | one ES module per peer specifier + `importmap.json` in `vendor/`, deduped (ONE Solid), tree-shaken to the bindings `dist/` and the pages import |
| `ForkBuild.ts` | installs / builds `packages/solid-element` when its `node_modules` / `dist/` are missing or stale (`vendor`, `measure`) |
| `HostApp.ts` | compiles the Solid 2 host app (`frameworks/solid/app.tsx`) with Solid external |
| `SmokeRunner.ts` + `StaticServer.ts` | serves `dist/`, `vendor/`, `tools/`, `test/` from ONE static server, injects the import map, drives each page in headless chromium |
| `LocCount.ts` | lines / code lines per file, by group |
| `ReportTables.ts` | rewrites the `generated:<name>` tables of `docs/report.md` |
| `peers.ts` | the peer specifiers `dist/` imports |
| `hmr.e2e.ts` | `yarn test:hmr`:  dev server + headless chromium + real file edits, 8 scenarios |
| `screenshots.ts` | `yarn screenshots`:  one PNG per example pair of `demo/index.html` |
| `frameworks/` | host pages `vanilla` / `react` (esm.sh) / `vue` (unpkg) / `solid` (Solid 2 app + `identity.js` probe), the shared round trip `check.js`, `perf.html` |
| `smoke/` | extra import-map pages:  `compat-solid-1.9.html`, `translate.html`, `perf-adapter.js` |
| `demo/` | `yarn dev` pages:  every example side by side (`index.html`), `perf`, `translate`, `hmr`;  `fallback.html` is also a smoke page |

Order:  `yarn build`, `yarn vendor`, `yarn measure`, `yarn test` (writes `perf-results.json`), `yarn smoke`,
`yarn report`.

## Notes

- **Imports:**  these are node scripts run by `tsx`:  relative imports with `.ts` extensions (`../vite.config.ts`
  for `COMPONENTS` / `SHARED_ENTRIES` / `SOLID_EXTERNAL`), never the `$` aliases.  Browser-side helpers they
  serve (`test/PerfRun.ts`, `test/dictionary.es.ts`) are transpiled on the fly by `StaticServer` and may import
  types only.
- **Pages:**  a smoke page imports `@spell/ui...` and the peers by specifier, and publishes
  `window.smokeResult = { ok, label, checks }`.  `kind: "compat"` is reported as COMPATIBILITY.  A page module
  that imports a peer binding itself must be listed in `PeerVendor`'s `usedBy` (`cli.ts`), or the vendored
  file lacks it ("does not provide an export named ...").
- **The identity probe** (`frameworks/solid/identity.js`) is the ONLY place that proves the host app and the
  components share one Solid;  it binds `createSignal` / `render` and never `import * as` a package, so the
  vendored Solid stays tree-shaken.
- **Buckets:**  any module `package.config.ts` can't place is `other` and fails the `unattributed` check;  a
  `shared:<name>` module outside `<name>.js` fails `coreOutsideCore`.
