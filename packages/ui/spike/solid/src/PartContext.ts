/**
 * The OWNER of one element acting as a generic content part (`<ui-header>` in a card, `<ui-detail>` in a label,
 * `<ui-label>` in a statistic, `<ui-icon>` in `<ui-icons>`), plus the page-wide registry of who owns what.
 * - Resolution is `OwnerContext.find()` over the flat tree, with a `barrier` at every registered NON-part
 *   component:  a header inside a segment inside a card stays standalone, as Fomantic's child combinators have it.
 * - `direct` mode (icons):  only the flat-tree parent component counts, skipping its own shadow internals
 *   (`.ui.icons > .icon`).
 * - SIDE EFFECT:  keeps `:state(in-<owner>)` on the host in step with `owner`, via an effect;  NEVER the static
 *   `in-<owner>` class.
 * - Re-resolves on:
 *   - every connect after the first (`keepAlive` keeps the controller across moves, so a part re-parented into
 *     another owner hears it through the fork's `onConnect`), a microtask late:  the hook may run inside a
 *     Solid render, where the signal write would throw
 *   - `slotchange` in any spike element's shadow root, for the elements entering AND leaving that slot
 *     (`UIElement` calls `PartContext.slotChanged()`), cascading to part descendants
 *   - once after the first settle, for owners whose shadow rendered after this part connected
 * - NOTE: no platform event says "my assigned slot changed";  a FOREIGN component re-slotting a part
 *   isn't seen until the part reconnects.
 * - MUST be created under the element's owner (field initializer / constructor):  it creates a signal and an effect.
