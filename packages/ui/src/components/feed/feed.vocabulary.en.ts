/**
 * Every name `<ui-feed>` and `<ui-event>` use:  tag, attributes (kind + allowed values), slots, parts, states.
 * Schema:  `ComponentVocabulary` (`$/vocabulary`).
 * - Class words come out through `ClassBuilder`, in Fomantic's grammar:
 *   `<ui-feed connected ordered size="small">` => `ui small connected ordered feed`;  an event has no `ui`
 *   (`<ui-event basic>` => `basic event`).  `feed.css` keys on those.
 * - The FEED owns the content parts (`ownsParts`):  an event is a part itself, transparent to their climbs, so
 *   `<ui-summary>`, `<ui-date>`, `<ui-meta>`, `<ui-extra>`, `<ui-author>` (Fomantic's `.user`) inside it get
 *   `:state(in-feed)` -- Fomantic's `.ui.feed > .event > .content .summary`.
