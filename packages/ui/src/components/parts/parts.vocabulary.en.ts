/**
 * Every name the generic content parts use -- `<ui-content>`, `<ui-header>`, `<ui-description>`, `<ui-meta>`,
 * `<ui-extra>`, `<ui-actions>`, `<ui-title>`, `<ui-summary>`, `<ui-date>`, `<ui-author>`, `<ui-avatar>`,
 * `<ui-detail>`, `<ui-value>`.  Schema:  `ComponentVocabulary` (`$/vocabulary`).
 * - The noun IS the part word, and the class it renders:  `<ui-meta>` => `<div class="meta">`.  Parts have no
 *   `ui` class (`ui: false`), except a STANDALONE `<ui-header>`, which is Fomantic's `ui header`.
 * - Owners declare what they own (`ownsParts` in THEIR vocabularies);  `OwnerContext` finds a part's nearest
 *   owner and the part sets `:state(in-<owner>)`.  Each part's `states` lists the owners Fomantic styles it in.
 * - `<ui-header>` owns parts too:  a nested `<ui-header>` is its sub header, a `<ui-content>` its text column.
 * - `parts.css` styles every part;  see its header for the owner tokens owners must set.
