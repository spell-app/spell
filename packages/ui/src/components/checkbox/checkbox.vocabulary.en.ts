/**
 * Every name `<ui-checkbox>` and `<ui-radio>` use:  tags, attributes (kind + allowed values), events, slots, parts,
 * states, texts.  Schema:  `ComponentVocabulary` (`$/vocabulary`).
 * - Class words come out through `ClassBuilder`, in Fomantic's grammar:
 *   `<ui-checkbox type="toggle" size="large" fitted>` => `ui large toggle fitted checkbox`;  a `<ui-radio>` is
 *   `ui radio checkbox` (the element adds `radio` unless its `type` is `slider` / `toggle`).
 * - `type` is `kind: "color"`:  it emits its value alone, right after the colour, as Fomantic writes it.
 * - Chosen state:  `selected` is canonical (`AGENTS.md`);  `checked` is accepted as an alias -- the host's `checked`
 *   PROPERTY reads and writes `selected`, and a `checked` ATTRIBUTE in markup selects it (the host class,
 *   `CheckHost`, owns that alias:  it is not a vocabulary attribute).
